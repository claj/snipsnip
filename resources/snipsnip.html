<p>Don't miss the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UmlIUvlaB_Y#t=193">hillarious video</a>.</p>

<p id="verse-one">Conrad's mother said Conrad dear<br/>
I must go out and leave you here.<br/>
but mind now, Conrad, what I say,<br/>
don't suck your thumbs while I'm away.</p>

<p>snip! snip</p>

<p id="verse-two">that great tall tailor, he always comes<br/>
for naughty boys who suck their thumbs<br/>
and ere they wonder what he's about,<br/>
he's got his great long scissors out.</p>

<p class="refrain">snip snip the scissors go<br/>
and Conrad cries out oh!<br/>
snip snip they go so fast,<br/>
and Conrad's thumbs will be off at last.</p>

<p id="verse-three">well, mama had scarcely turned her back,<br/>
when the thumbs were in , alack! alack!<br/>
the door burst open and in he ran,<br/>
that great long legged scissor man.</p>

<p class="refrain">snip snip the scissors go<br/>
and Conrad cries out oh!<br/>
snip snip they go so fast,<br/>
and Conrad's thumbs are off at last.</p>

<p id="verse-four">well, mama comes home and there Conrad stands,<br/>
and he looks quite sad as he shows his hands,<br/>
Ha! Ha! said mama, I knew he'd come,<br/>
for naughty little suck-a-thumb.</p>

</p id="outro"><b>CHORUS</b> and Conrad breathes his last.<br/>
<b>CHORUS</b> and Conrad bleeds to death at last.</p>
